Error #3 – VirtIO NIC Driver Missing

Context (what I was doing)
While configuring the Windows Server 2019 VM (Win-Server-AD) on Proxmox with a VirtIO network adapter, Device Manager showed the NIC was not recognized. The VM had no working network connectivity.

Error Message (short description + screenshot placeholder from Error-3/)
Device Manager displayed the NIC under Other devices as Ethernet Controller with a yellow exclamation mark.

Root Cause
Windows Server installation media does not ship with VirtIO drivers. Since the VM network interface was configured as Red Hat VirtIO Ethernet Adapter, the OS could not automatically load a driver.

Fix Applied

Mounted the VirtIO ISO (virtio-win-0.1.271.iso) in Proxmox as a secondary CD drive.

In Device Manager → Right-click NIC → Update Driver → Browse.

Navigated to the VirtIO ISO contents.

Selected the correct driver for the NIC.

Successfully installed the Red Hat VirtIO Ethernet Adapter driver.

Verified NIC appeared under Network adapters without warnings.

Lesson Learned
When using VirtIO hardware for Windows VMs in Proxmox, VirtIO drivers must be installed manually from the ISO. Always keep the VirtIO ISO mounted during installation/configuration to resolve missing device driver errors quickly.
